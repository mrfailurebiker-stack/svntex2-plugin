# Session Changelog & Conversation Summary

This file aggregates key development actions performed in the most recent session before VS Code restart.

## Recent Implemented Features
- Inventory transactional decrement with automatic product stock_status sync.
- Low stock & out of stock hooks: `svntex2_low_stock_variant`, `svntex2_out_of_stock_variant`.
- Email notifications for low stock / out of stock (throttled; configurable enable, threshold, recipients).
- Admin Settings tab extended: inventory alert controls (enable, threshold, recipient emails).
- REST endpoint `GET/POST /wp-json/svntex2/v1/stock/settings` for managing stock alert settings.

## Modified Files
- `includes/functions/products.php`: Added notification actions + comments.
- `includes/functions/admin.php`: Extended settings UI & persistence for stock alert options.
- `includes/functions/rest-products.php`: Added stock settings REST endpoints.

## New Options
- `svntex2_low_stock_threshold` (int, default 5)
- `svntex2_stock_notify_enabled` (1/0)
- `svntex2_stock_notify_emails` (comma separated list)

## Notification Throttling
- Low stock: one email per variant every 6 hours while remaining qty <= threshold.
- Out of stock: one email per variant every 3 hours while qty == 0.

## Pending Next Steps
1. Order status workflow (statuses: processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled) + transitions & audit log.
2. Order management admin UI (list + detail view with status change controls).
3. Vendor order grouping & export/email integration.
4. Reporting enhancements (inventory valuation, sales by product/variant once order flow enriched).
5. Customer management expansions (filters, recent orders, wallet summary integration).

## Notes
- Profit margin remains hidden from non-admin REST consumers.
- Stock settings page requires `manage_options` capability.
- Hooks can be extended to integrate third-party notification channels (Slack, SMS) via additional listeners.
